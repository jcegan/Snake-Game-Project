Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game project! This is a classic implementation of the Snake game where you control a snake to eat food and grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.

Features:

-Simple and intuitive gameplay

-Increasing difficulty as the snake grows

-Real-time score tracking

-Responsive controls (arrow keys)

-Reset functionality to start a new game


How to Play:

-Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.

-The snake must eat the food (represented by a ball) to grow longer.

-Avoid colliding with the walls or the snakeâ€™s own body.

-The game ends when the snake crashes into itself or the walls.
